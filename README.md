# Haskell Programming Language
This repository contains a custom programming language developed in Haskell. The language has been designed and implemented to achieve Turing completeness, demonstrating its ability to simulate a Turing machine and perform any computation describable through algorithms.
# Features
Turing Complete: Capable of executing any computation that can be expressed algorithmically.
Haskell Implementation: Built entirely in Haskell, leveraging its powerful functional programming paradigm.
Custom Language Design: Designed from the ground up with a unique syntax and set of features tailored to specific use cases.
# Getting Started
To explore this language's capabilities, clone the repository and follow the setup instructions in the README. Test cases and examples are provided to showcase its computational power and flexibility.
